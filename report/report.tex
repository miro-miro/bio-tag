Models of computation are theoretical models, that are used to prove what kind
of computations are possible. One of the most studied models is the universal
Turing machine, which largely defines what computation means nowadays. Another
model, the 2 tag system, can be used to emulate a universal Turing machine. It
works on a string by removing symbols from the front and conditionally appending
symbols at the end. Design of a 2 tag system as a biomolecular process allows us
to compute any problem that can be solved by a universal Turing machine. We
propose an implementation which uses DNA ligation and restriction enzymes to
compute a program that is implemented in a set of engineered sequences.

\section{Introduction}

A $m$ tag system is a computational model, that operates on a string of symbols.
At each step it reads the first symbol, removes $m$ symbols from the head of the
string and then appends a sequence of symbols based on the symbol it read to the
string. Mathematically the tag system can be described by the number of symbols
that are removed $m$, the alphabet $\Sigma$ of symbols used and the production
rules, $\Sigma \to \Sigma*$.

% 2 powers of 2 example here.

In the following sections we will first propose a general outline of an
implementation of a 2 tag system and discuss it's features and limitations based
on the processes involved and earlier iterations (namely the iteration we
presented during the last lecture).

\section{Biological Tag System}

\begin{note}
  Unfortunately it turns out that the design of a biological tag system is not
  very easy. (Who would have thought...) However as we still consider it quite
  an interesting idea, we decided to design one for the purpose of discussing
  the solution, its problems and workarounds and the requirements to actually
  make it work.
\end{note}

As an alphabet we use short sequences of DNA which encode a single symbol each.
Our input consists of a sequence of these encodings, where the first symbol
forms a sticky end and the end of the sequence is also exposed as a sticky end.
The general idea is to recognize the first symbol and then conditionally append
the desired production sequence.

This poses the first big design challenge. On one end of our input we have a
specific sticky end, but on the other end we have an unspecific one. Depending
on the one on the front, we need to make sure we only append the correct
sequence. Naturally two basic approaches come to mind.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Produce or activate the production sequence after detection
  \item Form a plasmid, where the production rule is a sequence connecting both
    ends
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Plasmid Formation}

Forming a plasmid by connecting the two ends of the input sequence with
production rule sequences seems very elegant at a first glance. The information
is transfered from beginning to end of the sequence by a single fitting
sequence. However, we can not ensure that plasmids properly ligate. It is
possible, even very likely, that two different production sequences ligate to
each end of the input sequence, and thus break the computation.

A program can be encoded as a set of production rules. Each production rule
contains the following four parts.

 \begin{enumerate}
   \item Recognition site: A sticky end consisting of four nucleotides encoding
     the symbol to be recognized.
   \item Restriction target: Two restriction enzyme targets. The first one
     deletes two symbols and opens a sticky end for recognition of the next
     read out. The second one prepares a sticky end on the current string to
     append the next tag.
   \item Production sequence: The sequence of symbols or tag, that needs to be
     appended. It only depends on the recognition site.
   \item Terminal site: A unique terminal sequence of length four that can be cut
     into a sticky end and support appending a sequence.
 \end{enumerate}

By opening up the sticky sequence after ligation of the recognition symbol, the
problem, where production sequences form chains rather that plasmids can be
solved. This could possibly be done using CRISPR/Cpf1. CRISPR/Cpf1 creates a 5'
overhang of length 4, 21 nt upstream from the PAM. The required PAM is 4 nt
long and would need to be contained between every symbol. Then a properly
constructed guide RNA can detect and cut. Putting a PAM between every symbol
causes sequences to be very long. Thus the cut distance of 21 nt is not
sufficient anymore. Also it imposes large constraints on the number of symbols
that can be encoded, since type IIS restriction enzymes do not cut any further
than 14 nt.

Unfortunately to this point we were unable to come up with a solution for this
problem. Restriction enzymes type IIIS, which cut much further away from the
recognition site, do not cut sufficiently precise.

% The program is encoded through a set of dsDNA sequences a sticky end on one end
% for symbol recognition. These dsDNA sequences encode the production rules, i.e.
% they encode, the mapping from each symbol to the string that is supposed to be
% appended. The production rules consist of four parts.

% The recognition site is a 5' overhang of length 4 and can only bind to a
% specific symbol on the current working string. 
% After the recognition site ligates to the production rule sequence, CRISPR/Cpf1
% with a corresponding guide RNA can be used to detect the ligation and open the
% sticky end of the terminal site.

% Subsequently the terminal site can ligate which leads to the formation of a
% plasmid. After knockdown of the guide RNA, we can activate the restriction
% enzymes. The first one, EciI, will remove 10 nucleotides and open a sticky end
% of length 4 and a 5'-overhang. Two of the nucleotides can be uniquely chosen for
% a symbol, while the other two are part of the PAM.

\subsubsection{Restriction Enzymes}

The constraints, restriction enzymes impose on the design of this system, are
very strong. Most Type IIS restriction enzymes do not cut sufficiently far away
to remove multiple symbols, while still maintaining PAMs or other spacer
sequences inbetween the symbols. Given that the CRISPR/Cpf1 complex creates
overhangs of length 4, we actually need to create spacer sequence of length 4,
which is the same between all symbols. Thus distance from the target size we
require the restriction enzyme to cut is $4 + x + 4 + x$, where $x$ is the
number of nucleotides we use for encoding the symbols.

Restriction enzymes that cut much further away than 10 nucleotides, namely type
IIIS restriction enzymes, unfortunately do so in a less precise way, i.e. the
cut distance may vary by two nucleotides and the cut length may also vary by
about two nucleotides. However, to fitting sticky ends we need to cut very
precise.

\subsubsection{Example}
To illustrate this design, we give an example encoding of a program that
multiplies two powers of two. The three symbols, X, Y and Z can be encoded as

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[mytext]  (letX)    {X:};
    \node[mytext, right of=letX]  (seqX)   {\ttfamily 5-AA-3\\\ttfamily 3-TT-5};
    \node[mytext, right of=seqX]  (letY)    {Y:};
    \node[mytext, right of=letY]  (seqY)   {\ttfamily 5-GG-3\\\ttfamily 3-CC-5};
    \node[mytext, right of=seqY]  (letZ)    {Z:};
    \node[mytext, right of=letZ]  (seqZ)   {\ttfamily 5-CC-3\\\ttfamily 3-GG-5};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Thus the initial input of a program that multiplies 2 by 2, XXYY, is

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[mytext] (seq) {
      \ttfamily 5-AATTTAATTTGGTTTGGTTT-3\\
      \ttfamily 3-\ \ \ \ ATTAAACCAAACCA\ \ -5
    };
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The production rules are
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[mytext] (prodX) {X $\to$ X:};
    \node[mytext, right=of prodX] {
      \ttfamily 5-AATT\textcolor{cyan}{GCGATG}\textcolor{blue}{GGCGGA}\textcolor{magenta}{(N)}AAAAAAA-3\\
      \ttfamily 3-\ \ \ \ \textcolor{cyan}{CGCTAC}\textcolor{blue}{CCGCCT}\textcolor{magenta}{(N)}TTTTT\ \ -5
    };
    \node[mytext, below=of prodX] (prodY) {Y $\to$ YZ:};
    \node[mytext, right=of prodY] {
      \ttfamily 5-AACC\textcolor{cyan}{GCGATG}\textcolor{blue}{GGCGGA}\textcolor{magenta}{(N)}AAACCAAAGGAA-3\\
      \ttfamily 3-\ \ \ \ \textcolor{cyan}{CGCTAC}\textcolor{blue}{CCGCCT}\textcolor{magenta}{(N)}TTTGGTTTCC\ \ -5
    };
    \node[mytext, below=of prodY] (prodZ) {Z $\to$ ZZ:};
    \node[mytext, right=of prodZ] {
      \ttfamily 5-AAGG\textcolor{cyan}{GCGATG}\textcolor{blue}{GGCGGA}\textcolor{magenta}{(N)}AAAGGAAAGGAA-3\\
      \ttfamily 3-\ \ \ \ \textcolor{cyan}{CGCTAC}\textcolor{blue}{CCGCCT}\textcolor{magenta}{(N)}TTTCCTTTCC\ \ -5
    };
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
where the letters N correspond to padding (magenta), the cyan sequence is the
FokI target site, the blue sequence is the EciI target site, and the S represent
the possible terminal sequences.
